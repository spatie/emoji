In PHP, you can display emoji characters just by typing them:

```php
echo "ðŸ˜ƒ";
```

This package provides some functionality to work with emojis if your IDE or used font can't render them correctly:

```php
Emoji::grinningFace();
```

## Install

You can install the package via composer:
``` bash
composer require spatie/emoji
```

## Usage

The `Spatie\Emoji\Emoji`-class contains character constants that may be used directly:

```php
Emoji::CHARACTER_GRINNING_FACE;
```

Or you can use the shorter method by leaving off "character" and using camelCase:
```php
Emoji::grinningFace();
```

If you want to get an array containing all emojis, you can use this method:
```php
Emoji::all();
 ```

You can also use an [ISO 3166 Alpha2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) country code and get the appropriate flag for the country:
```php
Emoji::countryFlag('be'); // ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª
```

This package contains Full Emoji List v13.1 based on https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/13.1/emoji-test.txt all methods and constants are auto-generated.
